# Blog ðŸ“„

A blog.  Uses [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) as a template.

I don't plan to write daily, weekly, or even monthly - just whenever I have something I decide is worth sharing.

I have been wanting to set up a blog for quite some time since I've always felt like the best way to learn something is to write about it.  I do a lot of little side projects and a lot of hacky things at work, and I'd love to be able to write a short blurb about it every once in a while.

Current ideas for blog posts:
- github.com/Shamus03/nasa-apod-background
  - First time writing a debian package
  - Short debconf + debian package tutorial?
- github.com/Shamus03/dotfiles
  - gnu stow
- How I built this blog
  - https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper
- github.com/Shamus03/ralc
- IonWave upload
- KeepassXC + Syncthing
- Connect to VM + Labatt Menubar shortcuts
