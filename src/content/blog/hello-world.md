## Why write a blog?

Sometimes I work on fun projects that I'd like to write more formally about. This site is a place for me to brag about those projects. Or maybe I can just dump random ideas I have here?

Writing regularly also helps improve one's writing skills. I take pride in the effort I make to write well-structured, thoughtful content in emails, documentation, and anywhere else I need to write more than a few words. I also strongly believe the best way to learn anything is to write about it.

Although I expect most of the content here to be tech-related rather than personal events, I hope this can act like sort of a time capsule. Some time years in the future I can look back at the posts I made and think "I remember when I did that!"

I don't plan to write daily, weekly, or even monthly - just whenever I have something I decide is worth sharing.

## About this site

I saw a post about [Astro](https://astro.build/) somewhere and thought it looked cool. It's a great way to build a site with static content, with little sprinkles of JavaScript here and there. I searched around for themes and landed on the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) template, so I started from there and ripped out the things I don't need. Although it's mostly copied from a template, I made sure to understand everything that went into this site from top to bottom.

After tweaking some colors (if you know me, you know if something is purple it must have been made by me) we are on our way!
