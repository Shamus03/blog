I'm Shamus, a full stack software developer living in Texas. I enjoy automating things and, more generally, helping people do their jobs faster.

## Tech Stack

This blog is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents.

The site is based on the AstroPaper theme by Sat Naing. Normally I enjoy making my own things from scratch, but my main focus here was just getting something up and running. I have certainly spent some time making sure I understand everything in this theme, despite not writing it entirely on my own.
